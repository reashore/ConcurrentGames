How to create a C# class from a SportRadar XSD file using Command Prompt

1) Download the XML schema file from SportRadar and save to a local temp directory
2) Check the schema header for schema include files
3) Download all schema include files using the same base URL as the schema to the temp directory
4) Open a CommandPrompt and switch to the temp directory
5) Run the command: xsd schemaFileName.xsd /classes /fields
6) This will generate a file schemaFileName.cs in the temp directory
7) Add using statements to the top of the .cs file in order to shorten fully-qualified variable names
8) The .cs file file will have a large number of ReSharper warnings because it does not follow C# naming conventions.
9) Create a test to deserialize the file
10) Proceed class by class to fix the invalid naming conventions
11) Run the test after each batch of name fixes to enure that they worked
